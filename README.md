# QIL Networked Instrument
Big read me incoming, any day now.
 
# Installation
It is important that the driver is installed in a permanent location, and remains in its git repository for pulling updates
 
Install is from the package directory
 
```
pip install --editable .
```
The `--editable` flag means the installed script just points back to the folder so updates are properly reflected, hence the need for a permenant location, and clear names.
